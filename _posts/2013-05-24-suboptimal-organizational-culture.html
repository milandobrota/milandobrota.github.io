<p>There are always other things to address. There is always something else to do, or some other place to be at.</p>
<p>Being driven by urgency, you will always be busy, but the output will not be optimal. It&#8217;s not about being busy and feeling productive, but about being smart and doing things that are optimal for the growth of the organization you&#8217;re part of. The <em>important</em> things.</p>
<p>The low urgency tasks never get done. Being aware of importance, and not just urgency will put things back into perspective.</p>
<p>But how important is organizational culture?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to measure the effects of a good culture on a company&#8217;s profits. But you can measure the negative effects of turnover. And that does not even include disengagement, the lack of care and motivation, and lack of trust between people.</p>
<p>Once the importance of the organizational culture is realized, the next obstacle to overcome is the fact that there is no easy fix. There are no exact steps that you can follow and process that you can enforce and make everything work.</p>
<p>This is not a to-do list. This is a leadership test. It is hard, but avoiding it is irrational. The worst thing that can happen is that nothing will change. The best thing that can happen is that you will have a workplace where people will feel respected, valued, trusted and engaged. It doesn&#8217;t take statistics or accounting reports to figure out which one is going to be more effective.</p>
