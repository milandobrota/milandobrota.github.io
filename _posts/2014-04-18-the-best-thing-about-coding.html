<p>…is that anyone can learn how to do it.</p>
<p>You don’t need a lot of money, a degree, or a team of people. All you need is a computer and the desire to learn.</p>
<p>The internet makes is very easy to share things with others, get feedback and improve. Every iteration takes your product and your skills to the next level.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s very easy to see if the feature you are working on is functioning properly. If you are working on a web app, sometimes all you need to do is reload the page (or better yet, automate it by writing a test).</p>
<p>Learning programming (and many other things) has never been easier. If you have never done it before, try it, even if you don’t plan on doing it professionally.</p>
<p>And if you are an experienced programmer, spend some time teaching others or building something cool just for fun.</p>
