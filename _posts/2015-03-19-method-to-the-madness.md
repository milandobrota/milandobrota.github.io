Two years ago, I let my daughter fill out my March Madness bracket.

She was 9 at the time and didn't know anything about college basketball. She picked teams based on what names she liked better.

I don't remember the exact number of brackets in the pool, but it was probably around 30. My daughter's bracket ended up in the second place. She actually had the lead for most of the tournament, but lost the lead in the finals, when Louisville defeated her top pick, the Michigan Wolverines.

Not bad for a 9 year old girl.

This year, her school has a pool and I helped her with her bracket. Do I think this bracket will be as successful? I doubt so.

But that's OK. We stick together, no matter if we're winning or losing.
