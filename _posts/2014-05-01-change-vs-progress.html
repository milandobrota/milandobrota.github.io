<p>Changes are guaranteed, but progress is not.</p>

<p>A programmer who looks at her old code and realizes how inefficient or clumsy it is should be proud of herself. She has obviously improved a lot, but until this point that might not have been so obvious.</p>

<p>The progress always happens slowly, and never by accident.</p>

<p>The fact that her code wasn&#8217;t perfect didn&#8217;t stop her from writing more code. And being consistent paid off.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that she could&#8217;ve said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have what it takes. I&#8217;ll never be a decent programmer. I&#8217;m not good enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>We say (or think) these things to protect ourselves from failure and embarrassment. But our self worth is impossible to measure. It doesn&#8217;t include just our being, but our becoming too.</p>

<p>Programming (and many other things) can be learned no matter what your previous experience is and what your diploma says.</p>

<p>Even the experienced programmers need to keep their skills up-to-date to stay relevant. The world is moving fast and the technology keeps evolving, creating new possibilities and opportunities, as well as changing the rules and expectations.</p>

<p>It is a revolution that abandons the old and embraces the new. Being able to learn quickly and adapt to the changes has never been more important.</p>
