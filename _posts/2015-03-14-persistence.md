How do you view obstacles, setbacks and rejections?

If you're like most people, you'll find them frustrating, discouraging, or maybe even see them as a sign that you're not good enough and that you should stop. They stress you out, wear you down and destroy your self-esteem.

The thing is... the resistance isn't the enemy. It's part of the work itself. It makes the work challenging and pushes you to improve your skills and create better and more meaningful things. If there are no obstacles, setbacks or rejections in your work, you're probably playing it too safe. Embrace the resistance and keep going.
