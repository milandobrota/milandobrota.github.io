<p>Different is strange, awkward and uncomfortable. It challenges people’s beliefs and makes them feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Most people avoid the different. The questions: “Is she a good fit?” and “That’s how we do things around here.” reveal this attitude.</p>
<p>They want the things to remain the same.</p>
<p>It is easy to agree with somebody if you share the same set of values.</p>
<p>Apple fans understand and agree with other Apple fans. Programmers understand programmers. Business people understand business people. It is when the cross communication occurs, that’s often problematic.</p>
<p>Surrounding yourself with like-minded people to protect your beliefs is not much different from closing your eyes and shouting the story you keep telling yourself.</p>
