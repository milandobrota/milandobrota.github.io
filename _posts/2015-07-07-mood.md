In the [previous blog post](/2015/07/05/priming.html) we talked about how our environment can unconsciously influence our behavior.

Another thing that can do that is our mood.

We all know that intense emotions can push us to take action. If someone offends you, and you get angry, there's a pretty high chance that you'll react in one way or another.

But what's more interesting, is that our moods, which are more subtle, and often unconscious, can still have a significant impact on how we behave.

In 2011, a team of psychologists led by Marc A. Brackett from Yale University designed a [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13540602.2013.827453) in which two groups of middle school teachers were asked to evaluate an essay.

The first group of teachers was induced to feel positive emotions by eliciting pleasant memories, and the other group was asked to remember a negative event from their life.

What was the result? On average, the positive emotion group rated the same essay significantly higher than the negative emotion group.

When the teachers were asked whether their mood affected their grading decisions, most of them said no.

A similar result was observed in a different [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1987.tb00298.x/abstract), in which job applicants were rated more favorably if the person interviewing them was in a good mood.

Another [study](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/181/12/933.full) found that the weather on the day of the medical school interview plays a role in the evaluation of the applicants.

These are only some of the many reasons why emotional awareness is so important. People who are willing to acknowledge their feelings are [less likely](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103103000258) to be affected by them when it comes to judging other people.
