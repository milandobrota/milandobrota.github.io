<p>Automate as much as you can.</p>
<p>Automate application testing, system health, reports or anything else that you need to do or check over and over, the same way every time.</p>
<p>Your automation scripts can run when you&#8217;re on vacation, when you&#8217;re sick, and on the weekends. You don&#8217;t need to remember anything, and the scripts can notify you (by sending you an email, for example) when there&#8217;s an error.</p>
<p>If you do this right, it will free up your time, allowing you to focus on things that require your brain, and not just your fingers, such as making decisions, fixing bugs, gathering requirements and other creative tasks.</p>
<p>By the way, if you aren&#8217;t a programmer and don&#8217;t know how to code, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help. Programmers help each other all the time, and many of them will be happy to help you too.</p>
