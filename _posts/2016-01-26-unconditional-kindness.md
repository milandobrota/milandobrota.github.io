My last name means _kindness_.

Kindness often comes back to you. But that's not why I try to be kind.

I don't give so I can get something later. Honestly, I don't even expect a thank you.

When I give, it is only because I want to. It is part of who I am. It feels good to make someone's life a little better, even if only for a moment.

I can't control what other people think of me, or how they treat me. What I *can* control is what I think of and how I treat *them*.
