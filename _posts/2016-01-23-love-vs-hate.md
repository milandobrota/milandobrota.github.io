My Twitter friend [Meika Mashack](https://twitter.com/Meika_Mashack) posted something really inspiring a few days ago that I wanted to share:

_I try to remind myself daily, for every hateful word I read, two loving words I must write._

Such a powerful statement! There's a lot of negativity in this world, and fighting it with more negativity only makes it worse. Being caring, loving and respectful, even towards those who might not share the same values as us, is what can turn things around and make this world a better, more hopeful place.
