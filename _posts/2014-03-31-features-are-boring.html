<p>People don&#8217;t care about features. They don&#8217;t care about what you did. What they want to know instead is how the thing you built can help them.</p>
<p>They care about benefits, the meaning, the why. What is the purpose, the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve? Talking about the solution without mentioning the problem is confusing, dry and boring.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about you. It&#8217;s about the people you serve.</p>
