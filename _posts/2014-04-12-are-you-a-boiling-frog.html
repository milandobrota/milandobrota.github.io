<p>If you drop a frog into hot water, the frog will get burned and jump out.</p>
<p>But if you put the frog into cold water, and then increase the temperature gradually, it will get cooked to death.</p>
<p>Beware of the small changes happening around you. Most people react to sudden changes, even if they don&#8217;t carry much importance in the long term. The sympathetic nervous system perceives the shock as a potential danger, and triggers the fight or flight response.</p>
<p>The slow sinking ship may be just as dangerous. Draw the line in advance, not when it&#8217;s too late.</p>
