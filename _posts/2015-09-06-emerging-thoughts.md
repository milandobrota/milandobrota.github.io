The reason why meditation is so hard is exactly what makes it so beneficial.

When you try to focus your attention on your breath, for example, you'll often find that your mind wanders. Yet these distracting thoughts that come up can give you a lot of insight into how you're feeling.

Sometimes, you'll think about what else you need to do. Or what you're missing out on while you're meditating. Sometimes you'll start falling asleep.

Whatever comes up reveals the nature of your mind at that moment. The anxiety. The tiredness.

We usually suppress these things out of our awareness because we're so busy. However, it's hard to live a meaningful life when you're not in touch with yourself because you're constantly distracted by your busyness.
