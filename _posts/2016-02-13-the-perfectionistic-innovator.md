Perfect ideas exist only in our heads. It is only when we try to turn an idea into reality, that we truly become aware of all the problems and obstacles that stand in the way.

If that's the case, is working on an idea worth the effort at all?

Of course it is. Imperfect realization of an idea is still better than doing nothing at all.

Not because the idea is guaranteed to have any kind of positive impact, but because working on it makes it real and gives it a chance to change the world.
