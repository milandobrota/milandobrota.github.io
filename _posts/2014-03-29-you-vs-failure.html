<p>It’s easy to be optimistic, confident and cooperative when the things are working. But what happens when there is a problem?</p>
<p>I play Lumosity, a set of games designed to improve cognitive processing, such as problem solving, flexibility and speed. When I play the speed games, I noticed that I’m doing pretty good until I mess up once. One failure almost always leads to another. Not because those failures are somehow related in the actual game, no, those events are designed to be completely independent.</p>
<p>However, they are related in my head. The first time I fail, I start thinking about failing, and I can’t focus on the game as much, which leads to more errors.</p>
<p>Don’t dwell on past failures. Keep going.</p>
