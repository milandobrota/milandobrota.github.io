<p>Don’t be afraid to admit to yourself what it is that you really want. Many people suppress their wants by being self judgmental, which then leads to confusion. They convince themselves that’s not how they really feel, but their actions ultimately reveal the truth.</p>
<p>Stop being in denial. Accept yourself.</p>
<p>Being aware of your needs and wants is the first step towards living a happy and fulfilled life. Your homework: Find out what results you are really after, and what those would really give you.</p>
<p>Think about this before you get the latest smartphone, accept a job offer or buy a new car.</p>
