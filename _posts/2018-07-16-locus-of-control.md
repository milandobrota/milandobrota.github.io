> Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult - once we truly understand and accept it - then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

It's true that life is difficult. There's so much uncertainty, so many stressful things that add up quickly. Each stage of life comes with new challenges and responsibilities.

When the going gets tough, I remind myself to focus on things that are in my control. How I think and what I do is something I have control over, but the other people's thoughts and behavior are not (for better or worse!)

Identifying what's in my control breaks me out of the cunning, alluring state of perpetual rumination and gives me a clear path forward. And if there's nothing I can do, regardless of how painful the situation may be, there's simply no other option, but to accept things the way they are.
