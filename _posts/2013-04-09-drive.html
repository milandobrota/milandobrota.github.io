<p><span>Drive is your ultimate resource. You might not be competent, but if you want it bad enough you&#8217;ll get where you want to be. The current situation might be less than ideal, but hey, that&#8217;s the world we live in. The good news is that if you try hard enough, you will find a way to make it work. You don&#8217;t need to be the best or have the best, just make the best of what you have. And lastly.. the only person you need to compete with is yourself. Don&#8217;t obsess about what others do or have. Some people are more likely to make a decision if they see a lot of other people doing the same. Don&#8217;t worry about that. Think for yourself. It&#8217;s your life. What you make of it is up to you and only you.</span></p>
