The reason why I love leadership isn't because I want to control other people or be better than them. It has absolutely nothing to do with authority or power.

The reason why I'm excited about leadership is because I believe in teamwork and helping other people. If I focused only on my individual abilities, I could only do so much. But if I instead focus on helping others improve their skills, reach their goals and become effective leaders themselves, the overall impact becomes much greater and the potential becomes unlimited.

To me, leadership isn't about telling others what to do. Instead, it is about caring, helping and teaching. Respecting other people's aspirations, not forcing my own. And when someone else's aspirations overlap with mine, together we can create (and grow) a powerful, resonant team, where each of us is truly excited about moving closer to our shared vision of the ideal future.
