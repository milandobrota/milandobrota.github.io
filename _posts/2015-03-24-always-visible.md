Leaders are more visible than other people. This means that, no matter what they're doing, there's a high chance that other people will notice it.

And it doesn't stop there. People don't just passively notice the leader's behavior. They accept it as a standard and mimic it.

A leader who stays calm under pressure, for example, will inspire others to do the same. Similarly, a leader that panics will create a culture characterized by false emergencies.

As a leader, you always lead by example and you always teach culture.
