We all know that when you lift weights, your muscles get stronger. But, it's not just muscles. It's also your tendons, ligaments and bones.

Comparing to muscles, these tissues take longer to adapt to the increased workload. The lack of balance can make you more susceptible to injury.

This is a great analogy for making changes in our lives. Sometimes, when we contemplate making a change, one area of our life might benefit from it, but the other areas may not be ready yet. Moving too fast can disrupt the balance.

Being mindful of all the different areas in your life can help you make better decisions and make changes that stick.
