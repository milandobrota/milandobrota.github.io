<p>It&#8217;s impossible to please everybody. But in our culture, some people find it difficult to say &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some will try to do everything that comes their way, spreading themselves too thin, and disappointing people in the end because they can&#8217;t keep their promises. Others will try to say no without saying the actual word. They will hint, beat around the bush, hoping that the other person will get it, and that they will avoid the conflict.</p>
<p>Saying no makes your yeses more credible.</p>
