<p>There are two ways to succeed. You can choose to become better, improve your skills and create more value, or you can badmouth the other people and point out their imperfections.</p>
<p>"If I can’t be/have something, you shouldn’t either" is a selfish way to look at things. Dog-eat-dog mentality doesn’t result in a better world. Drop the gun before you shoot yourself in the foot. Bad publicity can’t be washed off easily.</p>
<p>In addition, being competitive can make you feel like everything is a race. Your coworkers are not your competition. The blame game leaves no winners.</p>
<p>Root cause analysis should help you find the problem, not a scapegoat. Always remain focused on the future, not on who messed things up in the past.</p>
