<p>The Agile Manifesto says that agile developers value:</p>
<p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.<br/> Working software over comprehensive documentation.<br/> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.<br/> Responding to change over following a plan.</p>
<p>This is quite different than (the opposite of?) traditional project management. Both approaches bring an interesting perspective to the table, but in my experience, neither one will work 100% of the time. Make your own methodology - the one that works for you!</p>
