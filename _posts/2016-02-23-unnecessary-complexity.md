Making something unnecessarily complicated is often a sign of not understanding it well enough.

The best solutions are often elegant and easy to understand. They are free of bloat that comes with the lack of clarity and understanding, and free of complexity created by an ego that wouldn't want to settle for simple.

Simple things are easy to understand and adopt. They are exactly what they appear to be, and their benefits are obvious. On the other hand, complex things often get memorized without deep understanding, which leads to confusion and even more complexity.

Simple things are easy to change. Changing complex things evokes fear, and sometimes even self-doubt.

Simplicity requires diligence. The best solutions are rarely simple by coincidence. The end result may mislead us into believing that the creation process must have been simple, but that's an illusion. Solving a complex problem with a simple solution is hard work. The kind of work that's not the result of necessity, but that's it is inspired by caring.
