When you're in a meeting, you have a choice: you can pay attention and participate or you can wait for the meeting to end so you can go and do something else.

When a coworker is talking to you, it is tempting to assume that you know what he or she is going to say and start thinking about what you're going to say next instead of listening actively.

When you lift weights, do you focus on doing each rep correctly, with correct form and breathing or do you just [go through the motions](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/arnold-schwarzeneggers-blueprint-to-cut-vision.html)?

Paying attention is hard, but usually required for getting the results you want.
