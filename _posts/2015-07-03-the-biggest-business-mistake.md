The biggest business mistake is a very fundamental one: focusing too much on yourself.

Stop talking about how great you and your company are and shift the focus to the consumers. How does your product or service make _their_ life easier? What's the added value?

Less "I" and more "you" please.

P. S. Once you make the shift, the next question is "Can you be trusted?"
