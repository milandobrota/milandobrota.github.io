<p>Just because no one is complaining doesn&#8217;t mean that things are good enough. It may mean that the people stopped expressing their concerns, because there is no one listening, or caring.</p>
<p>Learned helplessness can be unlearned, but the environment needs to change first. You can be the one to start the transformation.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>By opening up, expressing your concerns and suggestions for improvement, and listening when others do the same. By asking for help, and offering help when others need it. By keeping the communication lines open, enabling people to work with each other, solve problems together, and ultimately create a better culture, where everybody feels empowered and resourceful, instead of feeling pessimistic, apathetic and disengaged. The culture where things happen, where the present is just a starting point, and the future is full of possibilities.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be worth your effort?</p>
