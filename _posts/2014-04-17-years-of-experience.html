<p>Years of development experience isn’t a good indicator of knowledge. Some jobs teach you more than others, and some people learn a lot in a short period of time doing side projects in addition to their full time work.</p>

<p>Don’t get discouraged if a job posting requires more years of experience than what you have. If you have the skills, are a quick learner, have a continuous track record of exceptional performance, or all of the above, you may be just the person they are looking for.</p>

<p>If not, the good news is that it’s never been easier to learn programming and build something worth showing your potential employers.</p>
