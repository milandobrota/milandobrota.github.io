<p>The only person who you should be competing against is yourself.</p>
<p>Realize that you have full control over your actions, thoughts, beliefs, values and emotions. Other people&#8217;s successes could be interpreted as a good thing; for example, you can be happy for someone finally achieving their dream, or contributing to something valuable.</p>
<p>But you can also use it to get depressed and tell yourself that you are a failure, and that you are worthless.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t experience reality. We experience interpretations of reality. There are multiple filters that distort limited quantities of information that we perceive and then try to make sense of.</p>
<p>Your ego is trying to protect you by shutting down the voice that&#8217;s telling you how much you are actually worth. The lizard brain is afraid, and it&#8217;s going to make sure you&#8217;re ready to deal with the danger.</p>
<p>But there is no lion chasing you.</p>
<p>This is when your conscious mind comes into play. Emotional pathways are quick, but not very reliable. After this you need to consciously decide whether the danger is real.</p>
<p>In this case the danger is not immediate. So you&#8217;re left with the feeling of being inadequate.</p>
<p>But you have a choice. You can use that feeling as a warning sign and use it as a motivator to push yourself in the right direction, until you feel more confident.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use the other people&#8217;s successes to your advantage. Try to figure out what factors contributed to their success, and start modeling them. This will save you some time on trial and error.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
