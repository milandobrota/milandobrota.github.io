<p>You don’t get chosen to be a leader. Or an artist. It all starts with a decision.</p>

<p>Good news is that you can lead and create art in anything that you do, in many different ways. There are no limits, and there are no instructions.</p>

<p>If you are looking for instructions, or doing things just like somebody else, then you are not a leader. Being a leader requires you to be innovative. Leading is art.</p>

<p>True artists are not in the game for the money. They are not driven by it and they don’t base their success on it.</p>

<p>What they want is to make a difference. And guess what - they always do.</p>
