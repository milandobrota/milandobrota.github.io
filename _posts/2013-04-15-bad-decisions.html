<p>Bad decisions are not always made the way you think.Â <span>The road of life doesn&#8217;t split into the right road and the wrong road.</span></p>
<p><span>Some decisions are made over and over. What this means is that you are incrementally giving more importance to the decision as time passes by. What initially didn&#8217;t seem like a big deal, accumulates and becomes a huge problem.</span></p>
<p><span>A sudden change gets our attention right away. Our fight or flight mechanism ensures that we handle the potential danger as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>But the slow approaching danger is in the dead angle. Don&#8217;t be too busy to notice it.</span></p>
