If you want to become an effective leader, start by figuring out what you need to do to lead one person effectively.

Just one. Reach out to this person, and focus on serving him or her until you figure out what it takes and until your behavior becomes internalized and effortless. Then do it with two people, and three, and so on.

Focusing on one person forces you to pay attention to the quality of the relationship, not just mere quantity.

Similarly if you want to manage projects well, start by managing a simple project or a small part of a complex project. Take responsibility for that micro project or feature and focus all attention and energy on it. Repeat that a few times and you'll notice patterns. Take advantage of what you learn and scale up.

And by the way, the same thing works with:

- Products and consumers
- Services and clients
- Social networks and followers
