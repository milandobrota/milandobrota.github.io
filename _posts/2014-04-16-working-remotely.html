<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter where you work from&#8230; as long as you get things done. If you are productive and accessible, why would you need to come to the office? Why would your job determine where you can live? And at the same time, why would a hiring manager limit the talent pool she can choose from?</p>
<p>The communication is not a problem anymore. Technology has made it possible to make video calls, conference calls and share your screen.</p>
<p>The question &#8220;How do I know if a remote employee is actually working?&#8221; is a sign of a much bigger problem. How do you know if the people in the office are actually working? Presence does not equal productivity. It&#8217;s a false sense of security.</p>
<p>People who don&#8217;t trust each other (regardless of whether the perception of untrustworthiness is real or not) won&#8217;t achieve extraordinary results no matter the environment.</p>
