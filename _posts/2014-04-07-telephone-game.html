<p>A message is likely to get distorted when there is a lot of degrees of separation between the people who are communicating. In some cases the message needs to go up the chain, where a boss needs to ask his boss for permission, or it comes from a customer, whoâ€™s trying to explain her problem to a support person, who doesn&#8217;t know much about the problem domain, and is unwilling to talk to someone who does.</p>
<p>The boss will unconsciously change the story based on his values and will probably not tell it with as much enthusiasm as his subordinate did.</p>
<p>The customer who gets the same non-helpful, generic response over and over is stuck and will go elsewhere.</p>
<p>For the right things to happen, it is very important that the right people get connected.</p>
