Today is leap day.

And for this reason, I'd like to challenge you to do something brave. Something different from what you usually do.

I'm challenging you to take a leap towards your dream. To muster up the courage to say no to your fears, and yes to your faith. To be true to yourself and give your dream a chance to become reality.

Even if it's a small leap, take it. Small leaps can lead to bigger leaps later on. Momentum is a powerful thing.

Taking a leap can be frightening. It's way more comfortable to not do anything, or do the same thing you did yesterday. But if you never take the leap, one day you may realize that it's too late, and regret not being brave enough.
