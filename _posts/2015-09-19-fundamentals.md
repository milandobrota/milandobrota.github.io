Fundamentals aren't sexy.

Our attention gravitates towards the new, cool, trendy, fancy, maybe even shocking or controversial.

However, the things that are often not talked about, the fundamentals, are often everything you need to get the job done. And get it done well.

It's easy to get distracted with the latest stuff.

But the newest diet may not work better than the traditional, balanced diet. The newest tool won't matter if you don't change your habits. And the newest software methodology buzzword or design pattern might not solve any of your problems.

Instead of constantly chasing the new, it may be more effective to spend time perfecting the fundamentals.
