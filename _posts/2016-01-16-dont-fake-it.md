I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of the saying "Fake it till you make it".

To explain why, I'll give you a fitness analogy.

Some people, trying to appear stronger than they actually are, lift heavier weights than they can handle. To accomplish this, they sacrifice their technique, impeding muscle development and risking an injury.

In short, taking on too much can make you crumble.

Faking things is not a good strategy. It doesn't feel right and it's a disservice to the people you work with.

Be honest. Honesty builds trust, and people who trust each other [get things done](http://www.hci.org/files/field_content_file/IA%20-%20June%202013%20-%20Building%20Trust%202013%20-%20Workforce%20Trends%20Defining%20High%20Performance.pdf).
