<p>What do you do if the rules don’t make sense?</p>
<p>1. Follow them, despite the fact that they don’t make sense<br/> 2. Follow them only when others are looking<br/> 3. Change them</p>
<p>The rules are created to serve us. Some of them made sense at one point in the past, but not anymore. The organizations need to adapt, and the change needs to come from individuals who are willing to speak not from their ego, but from their compassion and empathy. Having the ability to see the big picture and the courage to stand out and tell the truth might not be in your job description, but is at least as important.</p>
<p>People need you to lead. Will you?</p>
