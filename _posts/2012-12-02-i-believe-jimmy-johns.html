<p>I believe…<br/>
that two people can look at the exact same thing and see something totally different.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that your life can be changed in a matter of hours by people who don’t even know you.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that even when you think you have no more to give, when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that credentials on the wall do not make you a decent human being.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that the people you care about most in life are taken from you too soon.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that sometimes when I’m angry I have the right to be angry but that doesn’t give me the right to be cruel.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that just because someone doesn’t love you the way you want them to doesn’t mean they don’t love you with all they have.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you’ve had and what you’ve learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you’ve celebrated.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that it isn’t always enough to be forgiven by others. Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that no matter how bad your heart is broken that the world doesn’t stop for your grief.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that just because two people argue, it doesn’t mean they don’t love each other.  And just because they don’t argue, it doesn’t mean they do.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that you shouldn’t be eager to find out a secret.  It could change your life forever.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that it’s taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that you should always leave loved ones with loving well wishes. It may be the last time you see them.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that you can keep going long after you can’t.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that we don’t have to change friends, if we understand that friends change.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that no matter how good a friend is, they’re going to hurt you once in a while and you must forgive them for that.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that true friendship continues to grow, even over the longest distance. Same goes for true love.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that you either control your attitude or it controls you.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, that passion fades and there had better be something else to take its place.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that heroes are the people who do what has to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of the consequences.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that you can do something in an instant that will give you heartache for life.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that money is a lousy way of keeping score.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that my best friend and I can do anything or nothing and have the best time.</p>

<p>I believe…<br/>
that sometimes the people you expect to kick you when you’re down, will be the ones who help you get back up.</p>&#8212;Jimmy John&#8217;s
