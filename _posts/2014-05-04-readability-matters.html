<p>The computer might be able to understand your code, but what about your co-workers? Or you, a few months from now?</p>

<p>Put effort in making your code readable and understandable.</p>

<p>The first draft might pass the tests, but it is often cryptic and inelegant.</p>

<p>When a programmer starts building a functionality, she doesn&#8217;t know what classes, methods and variables she&#8217;ll end up with. She&#8217;s learning as she goes.</p>

<p>Eventually, the code will start working, but it will look like a brain dump. The code that &#8220;just works&#8221; is confusing and difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>Instead, spend some time refactoring the code. Imagine that you&#8217;re seeing the code for the first time - would you understand it?</p>

<p>Pay attention to naming. Make sure the intention is clear. Put comments where needed, or better yet, create readable, self-documenting code.</p>

<p>The tests are your safety net, so don&#8217;t be afraid of breaking stuff - be creative! Once you&#8217;re done, show the code to a coworker and ask for feedback. This way you&#8217;ll ensure that the code is high quality.</p>
