<p>Should you care about the things happening around you?</p>
<p>You may have three bugs to fix and a big feature to develop, and a tight deadline. It&#8217;s really tempting to get &#8220;wired in&#8221; and ignore everything around you.</p>
<p>You push hard and you get everything done. You feel amazing.</p>
<p>The problem? There is another set of bugs and features coming your way.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you&#8217;re a hamster in a wheel, where you never get to see the big picture or get involved in decisions. And if anyone should be involved, it should be you, because you know the system better than everybody else.</p>
<p>Rethink the wheel.</p>
