<p>It is amazing how the internet transformed the way the businesses are run. The abundance of available tools makes it easy for anybody to access information, connect with the potential customers and solve many other problems.</p>

<p>The tools are there for anybody to use, but that doesn&#8217;t mean people should use all of them (even if they are free). Social networks, for example, are a very popular way to connect with potential and existing customers, but spending a lot of time on every single one is an overkill.</p>

<p>This is especially important for small companies/projects. When your time is limited, you simply can&#8217;t afford to spread yourself too thin.</p>

<p>Does the potential commitment make you do more work (as opposed to making things more efficient)? If so, does it provide significant return or can you achieve similar results with the current set of tools?</p>
