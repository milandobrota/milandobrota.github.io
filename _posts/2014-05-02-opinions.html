<p>Opinions without context are usually wrong.</p>

<p>When talking about what&#8217;s better, regardless of whether we&#8217;re talking about software development processes, patterns or some other principles, it is very important to be clear on the parameters.</p>

<p>Just like the Newton&#8217;s first law is valid only in vacuum, every opinion requires certain assumptions to be true.</p>

<p>The problem arises when these assumptions get neglected as a factor, and a generalization takes place.</p>

<p>If a tool is slowing you down, and there is no progress, it&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;re using it wrong, but it&#8217;s more likely that you&#8217;re using the wrong tool.</p>
