Generally speaking, successful people tend to think that the reason why they've succeeded is because of their own character. People who fail to reach their goals blame the environment. This effect is known as [self-serving bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias).

Take a moment and think about all the people in your life who have helped you get where you are and who shaped you. Write down their names and what they did.

How does thinking about those people make you feel?

Whose list will you be on?
