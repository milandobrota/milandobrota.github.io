A lot of people ask me how to get a job as a programmer when you don't have a lot of experience.

The answer: Ask for a test project and do an outstanding job.

The main reason the interviewers care about your experience is because they want to assess your skills. It's all about the value you can bring into an organization.

Bonus points: I highly suggest that you create or contribute to an open source project. This is intimidating for a lot of people, but can be very useful because you can show and talk about the code you've written in a real world app.

Landing first job is hard, but we all started somewhere.
