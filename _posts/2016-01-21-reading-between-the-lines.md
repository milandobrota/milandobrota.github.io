Excellent observers have the ability to pick up on things that are not said. They notice facial expressions, tone of voice, body posture and other contextual cues which help them "read between the lines".

Paying attention to these kind of things can reveal subtle connections and patterns. This can sometimes make a difference between someone who really understands what's going on, and someone who's a little clueless.
