<p>Most of the startup founders (and employees) are young males. The kids are running the show.</p>
<p>This fact is true, but useless. Just because you&#8217;re young, and you&#8217;re male, that doesn&#8217;t make you a good employee, or startup founder. On average, women are intellectually as capable as men, while older people often have more experience, which can undeniably help you make better decisions.</p>
<p>You can make a difference no matter your age or gender. What&#8217;s between your ears matters more than your demographics.</p>
