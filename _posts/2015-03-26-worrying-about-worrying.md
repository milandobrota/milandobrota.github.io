One especially toxic characteristic of worrying is that it compounds.

You start by worrying about something, which, of course, already feels bad and is emotionally draining, but then you take it to the next level - you start worrying about worrying.

This is why sometimes people may feel bad, but unaware of the true reason that's buried deep down the worry chain. And many times, at the bottom of the chain, what they find is an exageratted catastrophic series of events and what-ifs which probably won't ever happen or something that's completely out of their control, both of which are pointless to worry about.
