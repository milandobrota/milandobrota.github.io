<p>The correlation between two things doesn&#8217;t imply that one causes another. Knowing one variable may allow us to predict the other one, but it doesn&#8217;t tell us why there&#8217;s a connection.</p>

<p>For example let&#8217;s consider the following statement (regardless of whether it&#8217;s actually true):</p>

<p>Most programmers are male.</p>

<p>What this statement means is that a person who writes code is more likely to be a man than a woman. But this doesn&#8217;t mean that being a male causes people to become programmers (and definitely doesn&#8217;t mean that being a programmer causes people to be male).</p>

<p>It tells us what to expect, but it doesn&#8217;t reveal the mechanism that influences these factors. In the previous example, the correlation may be high, but the relationship is not causal.</p>

<p>What may be happening under the hood is the presence of a third critical factor.</p>

<p>Consider the situation where the people who regularly take the vitamin X have less heart problems than the people who don&#8217;t. That can lead you to believe that the supplement has a positive effect on the heart&#8217;s health, but there is a flaw in that logic.</p>

<p>What if the vitamin X costs a lot of money, and its consumers are mostly wealthy people, who generally tend to eat healthier?</p>

<p>The numbers don&#8217;t lie. But be very careful when you interpret them.</p>
