Last night I watched a short video about Duško Vujošević, a well known Montenegrin-Serbian basketball coach. In the video he was coaching a young basketball player. Working with young players is one of his areas of expertise.

Besides teaching the technical aspects, he also worked on the young player's confidence. He was telling him that when he misses a shot, he should think: I'm going to make the next one.

If your skills are fundamentally sound, believing that you will make the most out of the next opportunity that comes, often results in a self-fullfilling prophecy. You simply keep trying and keep improving until you eventually succeed.
