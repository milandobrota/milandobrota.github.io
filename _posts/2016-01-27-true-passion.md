The best way to see if you're truly passionate about something is to commit.

Much like true love requires commitment, fleeting excitement or interest isn't true passion.

True passion is freedom to do anything, but choosing to do what you're passionate about.

True passion is sustainable. It renews and reinvigorates. It is a part of your identity.

What's your true passion?
