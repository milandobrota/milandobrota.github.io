Should you try to eliminate words like _just_ and _actually_ from your [speech and writing](http://goop.com/how-women-undermine-themselves-with-words/)?

Are the words _really_, _very_, _perhaps_ or _quite_ [too soft](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-tools/top-tens/ten-words-to-cut-from-your-writing/article15017159/)?

Does asking "Am I making sense" imply that you lack confidence? Does it conflict with your goal of being perceived as a good leader or a knowledgeable expert?

It's easy to nitpick about someone's communication style. But ultimately, the person who's listening to you, or reading your email or blog post, cares most about the content.

If you know what you're talking about, you're an expert in my book. A person who goes to a TED talk and leaves the room complaining about the words the speaker used is missing the point.
