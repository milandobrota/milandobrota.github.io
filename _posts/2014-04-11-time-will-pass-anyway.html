<p>It takes time to create something remarkable. It takes years to achieve excellence. The success does not happen over night.</p>
<p>When the media starts talking about a cool new startup, most people don&#8217;t see all the time and effort that went into it. Some people may start analyzing what the company did right, and how and why it succeeded.</p>
<p>You can always find an explanation. All the decisions the company made make sense now, because now you can clearly link them to their success. But did they make sense then, when the prize wasn&#8217;t guaranteed?</p>
<p>Making a difference takes guts. It is easy to find an excuse to quit before you even start. It&#8217;s easy to start thinking about years of work that you need to put in before you start seeing results.</p>
<p>The time is going to pass anyway. The question is, when it does, will you have anything to show?</p>
