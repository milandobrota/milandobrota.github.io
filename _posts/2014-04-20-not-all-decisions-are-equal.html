<p>We all want to make good decisions. But in many cases, there&#8217;s no way to find out whether the decision we&#8217;d like to make will work before we actually make it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a catch 22.</p>
<p>We research, and test, and ask other people to help us. We try to identify the risk and then minimize it.</p>
<p>This process can take a long time, and cost a lot of money. Is that a waste? It depends.</p>
<p>Not all decisions are equal.</p>
<p>In some cases, what you have is good enough. Things can always be better, but the return might not be worth the effort.</p>
<p>When you need to make a low-importance decision, timebox it.</p>
<p>The critical decisions, on the other hand, take time and money (sometimes in surprisingly large amounts). But that&#8217;s OK, because they will save you much more time and money later.</p>
