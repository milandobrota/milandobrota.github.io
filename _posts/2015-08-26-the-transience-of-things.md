It's my son's first birthday today. The first year flew by so quickly.

He changed a lot since he was a newborn. He got bigger, got his first teeth and his hair grew longer.

It is said that the only thing that is constant in life is change. It is true. The world around us is constantly changing, and many people have trouble accepting this.

Appreciate people and things that are in your life right now. Live in the present. For me, that means that it's time to celebrate! :) Who or what can you be grateful for?
