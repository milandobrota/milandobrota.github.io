One of my favorite words, besides the names of the people I love, is the word _why_.

The word why reveals the hidden connections. It makes things meaningful. It gives us a glimpse into the mysterious realm of our deep values and motives.

Without knowing the why, the how can go astray.

The why gives us deeper understanding. The context. The purpose.

Of course, I'm not talking about the why that's accusatory, cynical or desperate. I'm interested in the why that sparks curiosity and leads to an "aha!" momentâ€¦ or sometimes, another why.
