What's your first thought when you wake up in the morning?

Is it the frustration of not getting enough sleep? Thinking about what notifications and emails are waiting for you to check? Planning for the day ahead? Craving coffee? Worrying about not having enough time to get ready for work? Or is it something else?

Are those thoughts and emotions positive or negative? This matters a great deal, because they will set the tone for the rest of the day.

What can you do to start off on the right foot each morning? What kind of morning routine, or other change in your habits, would make your morning self happier and more inspired?
