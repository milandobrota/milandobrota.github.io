Happy New Year!

Most people see this moment as a blank slate, an exciting opportunity to start fresh. We give ourselves permission to dream, leave the past in the past, and focus on the future and make plans for a better life.

But when you think about it, January 1st is just like any other day. There is really no reason not to approach every other day with the same enthusiasm and excitement.

I know that most changes I've made in my life didn't happen on any special day. My New Year's resolution is to be more mindful of that, to treat every day as special, and give myself permission to dream. And of course, encourage others to do the same. :)

Thanks for reading. Have a wonderful year ahead!
