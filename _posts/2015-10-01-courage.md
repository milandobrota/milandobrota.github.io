Courage is not the same as fearlessness.

Courage doesn't mean that fear is absent. Quite the contrary, fear is an integral part of courage.

Courage means acting despite of fear. Not running away or shutting down, but stepping up and doing your best when it's hardest.

Don't expect the problems or fear to go away. Be bigger than them instead.
