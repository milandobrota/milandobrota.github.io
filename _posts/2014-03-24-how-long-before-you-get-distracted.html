<p>What do you do when you want to learn more about something?</p>
<p>The chances are, you would do a Google search, click on a couple of links and start reading. If you are really interested in the subject, you might even purchase a book or perhaps pick it from the library.</p>
<p>Most people stop there. A lot of books donâ€™t get read past the first chapter. The instant gratification of the information being available to you and the investment in the materials makes you feel good about yourself and gives you the feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>As with many other things, the more effort you put in reading and learning, the more you will get out of it. Do you have enough patience to keep investing in yourself and your skills, and enough courage to apply the things you learn?</p>
<p>You might have received your degree, but the school is not over yet.</p>
