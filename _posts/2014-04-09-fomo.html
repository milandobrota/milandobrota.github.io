<p>We live in a world surrounded with possibilities, connections and entertainment. There is so much to do, but so little time.</p>
<p>We are more connected than ever. We chase shiny new objects. We try to make most of every day.</p>
<p>We crave new experiences. Eating great food, playing realistic video games, seeing new places. Everything is so amazing that we often sacrifice sleep to get to do as much as possible.</p>
<p>But no matter how much you do, there will always be something you will miss out on. And you need to be OK with that.</p>
<p>Learn to be present, and enjoy the moment.</p>
