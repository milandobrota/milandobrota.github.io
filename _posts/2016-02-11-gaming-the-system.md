The problem with the metrics around employee performance is that the numbers can be manipulated. You can game the system.

If only individual performance is measured and incentivized, why would people spend time helping others and sharing knowledge?

If management complains when people take longer than expected, why wouldn't they overestimate their work next time around?

The numbers are important, but they can be misleading.
