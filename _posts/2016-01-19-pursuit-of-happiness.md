Meditation helped me a lot with the ability to just sit quietly and do nothing, resisting the urge to go on the internet, watch TV or make myself busy.

It might not sound like a great accomplishment, in fact it may even seem like a waste of time. But it's not. It's an opportunity for freedom, substituting escapism, shallow entertainment, false urgencies, noise, distractions and mindlessness for a moment or two thinking about deep, meaningful things you're truly grateful for.

Our goals sometimes feel like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, an illusion of happiness that can never be reached. This mindset can make us feel restless and anxious, and can make us behave in an impulsive and compulsive manner.

It's good to take a moment and tell ourselves that even without reaching that enticing goal, we have enough and are enough.
