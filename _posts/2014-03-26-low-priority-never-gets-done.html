<p>What&#8217;s low priority today will probably be low priority tomorrow. The top of the todo list gets the most attention, but as soon as those items get completed, new ones show up.</p>
<p>The bottom slowly becomes a mess and the list grows out of control.</p>
<p>Do you control the list or does the list control you? Do better work, not busy work.</p>
