<p>The best communicator isn&#8217;t the one who speaks the best. It is the one who is willing to listen.</p>
<p>A conversation turning into a monologue usually leads to a tangent story. Giving a speech or sending an email without knowing the audience/recipient is a shot in the dark.</p>
<p>A few right sentences might answer more questions than 10 meetings. To be able to reduce the noise, you must be willing to listen. </p>
