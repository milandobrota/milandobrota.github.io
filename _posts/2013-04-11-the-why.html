<p>A tool is useless and sometimes even dangerous if you don&#8217;t know how to use it properly. The what without the how is superficial, static and boring.</p>

<p>But the how alone is not enough.</p>

<p>The why separates mechanic from inspiring. The why gives us perspective, hope, vision, meaning, motivation, and purpose. The why crosses the line between reality and our dreams, it reveals a part of our personality, our goals and desires.</p>

<p>At times our actions can be difficult to understand. Don&#8217;t let that scare you. Finding out the reason behind your actions will tell you who you really are and what you stand for.</p>
