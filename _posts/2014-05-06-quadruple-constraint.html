<p>In project management, there is a model called Triple Constraint.</p>
<p>What this model represents is the relation between speed, scope and budget. For example, if you wanted to increase the speed at which the project is delivered, you could either hire more people (increase the budget) or decrease the scope. Similarly, if you wanted to increase the scope, you could either push the deadline back or again, add more people to the project.</p>
<p>What this model is missing is quality.</p>
<p>Many companies could deliver a product fast and cheap. The question is: Is the product going to be reliable, maintainable, available and safe?</p>
