What do you think about and feel when you're not doing anything? Is there a dominant emotion or thought that you always come back to?

By the way, this may not be something you can answer right away. If that's the case, next time you're waiting in line, laying in bed or just taking a break, pay attention and let it come to you.

Once you realize what it is, ask yourself these questions:

Is this thought positive or negative? Empowering or restricting? Is it rooted in your personal vision or a fear?

If you could, would you replace it? If so, what would you replace it with?

What would happen if you tried to replace the old thought with the new one?

The answer to the last question will reveal why you keep coming back to the old thought in the first place, which is exactly what you need to know to make this change.
