<p>Everybody wants something. It could be more friends, a better job (or any job), the newest gadget, a better body, wardrobe upgrade or more free time.</p>

<p>What you really want is the experience that thing will give you, not the thing itself.</p>

<p>The real question is: Once you acquire X how long will the desired experience last? Will the effect be long lasting, or are you merely distracting yourself?</p>

<p>Short term fixes are long term problems.</p>
