Hi! I am Milan Dobrota. I live in Ann Arbor, MI with my beautiful family.

I work as a Solutions Architect at Tribune Publishing. I work remotely, and I love it!

By night I teach people Ruby on Rails and I study psychology, neuroscience, organizational effectiveness and leadership.

This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences and the things I learn. I hope you find it interesting.
