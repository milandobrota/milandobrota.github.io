Hi! I am Milan Dobrota. I live in Ann Arbor, MI.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer/Team Lead at MDLIVE. I work remotely, and I love it!

I love reading about mindfulness, psychology, neuroscience and leadership, and I love watching basketball. Also, I'm learning how to play the piano - that's something I wanted to do for a long time!

This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences and the things I learn. I hope you find it interesting.
