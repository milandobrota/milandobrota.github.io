Hi! I am Milan Dobrota. I live in Ann Arbor, MI.

I work remotely as a Senior Software Engineer/Team Lead at MDLIVE.

I love reading about mindfulness, psychology, neuroscience and leadership, and watching basketball. Also, I've been learning how to play the piano - something I wanted to do for a long time!

This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences and the things I learn. I hope you find it interesting.
