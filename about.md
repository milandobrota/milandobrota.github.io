Hi! I am Milan Dobrota. I live in Ann Arbor, MI with my beautiful family.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer/Team Lead at MDLIVE. I work remotely, and I love it!

By night I study psychology, neuroscience, organizational effectiveness and leadership, and coach people who are interested in learning Ruby on Rails and/or improving their leadership skills.

This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences and the things I learn. I hope you find it interesting.
